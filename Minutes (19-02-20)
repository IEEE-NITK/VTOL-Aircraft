The total weight is expected to be around 1000grams and accordingly 2 motors each with thrust for 800 grams will be used.
The backup plan for the design is the same model with added control surface at the tail.
By the time of the next meet, the first years(mech) are expected to learn xflr5 and solidworks.
It is suggested that aerofoil be symmetric.*
The fuselage will be cylindrical.
It is assumed that the aircraft may not be capable to turn fully 90Â° with the help of the control surfaces we are using, and hence might take a larger radius while hovering.*
